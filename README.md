I got myself by an obsession, it's on another dimension
Don't need a whole lot protection
'Cause it gave me all I've been getting
It gave me life, hope, dreams, goals, you know, woah

You've got to give a little love, give a little love
You got to go on, just do it, you can't abuse it
Give a little love, give a little love
Go on and do it, go

Leaving in a world where there's plenty
So how come we're running all empty?
When we've been touched by so many
And still there's more without any
Without any life, hope, dreams, goals, you know, ohh

We've got to give a little love, give a little love
Go on, just do it, you can't abuse it
Give a little love, give a little love
Go on, just do it, go

You know you've got to do what you can
You know you've got to try to understand, yeah

You've got to give a little love, give a little love
Go on and do it, you can't abuse it
Give a little love, give a little love
Go on and do it, go

You've got to give a little love, give a little love
Go on and do it, you can't abuse it
Give a little love, give a little love
Go on and do it, go, oh yeah

Give a little love, give a little love
Give a little love, give a little love
Give a little love
